Kahu API Demo
=============

This repository contains a simple demonstration in Python of how to use the Kahu REST API to manage VM instances.  To run this demo:


1. Copy ```settings.py.example``` to ```settings.py```.
2. Update the contents of ```settings.py``` to match your environment/Kahu account information.
3. Run ```quickstart.py```.

Note: this demonstration launches instances with a throwaway SSH identity stored in ```id_rsa```.  This identity is not intended to be used in production or anywhere else.
